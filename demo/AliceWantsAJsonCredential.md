# How to Issue JSON-LD Credentials using Aca-py

Aca-py has the capability to issue and verify both Indy and JSON-LD (W3C compliant) credentials.

The JSON-LD support is documented [here](../JsonLdCredentials.md) - this document will provide some additional detail in how to use the demo and admin api to issue and prove JSON-LD credentials.


## Setup Agents to Issue JDON-LD Credentials

Clone this repository to a directory on your local:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python.git
cd aries-cloudagent-python/demo
```

Open up a second shell (so you have 2 shells open in the `demo` directory) and in each shell:

```bash
./run_demo faber --did-exchange`
```

```bash
./run_demo alice`
```

Note that you start the `faber` agent with AIP2.0 options.

Copy the "invitation" json text from the Faber shell and paste into the Alice shell to establish a connection between the two agents.

Now open up two browser windows to the [Faber](http://localhost:8021/api/doc) and [Alice](http://localhost:8031/api/doc) admin api swagger pages.

Using the Faber admin api, you have to create a DID with the appropriate:

- DID method ("key" or "sov")
- key type "ed25519" or "bls12381g2" (corresponding to signature types "Ed25519Signature2018" or "BbsBlsSignature2020")
- if you use DID method "sov" you must use key type "ed25519"

Note that "did:sov" must be a public DID (i.e. registered on the ledger) but "did:key" is not.

For example, call the `/wallet/did/create` endpoint with the following payload:

```
{
  "method": "key",
  "options": {
    "key_type": "bls12381g2" // or ed25519
  }
}
```

This will return something like:

```
{
  "result": {
    "did": "did:key:zUC71KdwBhq1FioWh53VXmyFiGpewNcg8Ld42WrSChpMzzskRWwHZfG9TJ7hPj8wzmKNrek3rW4ZkXNiHAjVchSmTr9aNUQaArK3KSkTySzjEM73FuDV62bjdAHF7EMnZ27poCE",
    "verkey": "mV6482Amu6wJH8NeMqH3QyTjh6JU6N58A8GcirMZG7Wx1uyerzrzerA2EjnhUTmjiSLAp6CkNdpkLJ1NTS73dtcra8WUDDBZ3o455EMrkPyAtzst16RdTMsGe3ctyTxxJav",
    "posture": "wallet_only",
    "key_type": "bls12381g2",
    "method": "key"
  }
}
```

You do *not* create a schema or cred def for a JSON-LD credential (these are only required for "indy" credentials).

Congradulations, you are now ready to start issuing JSON-LD credentials!

- You have two agents with a connection established between the agents - you will need to copy Faber's `connection_id` into the examples below.
- You have created a (non-public) DID for Faber to use to sign/issue the credentials - you will need to copy the DID that you created above into the examples below (as `issuer`).

To issue a credential, use the `/issue-credential-2.0/send` (or `/issue-credential-2.0/create-offer`) endpoint, you can test with this example payload (just replace the "connection_id", "issuer" key and "proofType" with appropriate values:

```
{
  "connection_id": "4fba2ce5-b411-4ecf-aa1b-ec66f3f6c903",
  "filter": {
    "ld_proof": {
      "credential": {
        "@context": [
          "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
          "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
        ],
        "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "UniversityDegreeCredential"],
        "issuer": "did:key:zUC71KdwBhq1FioWh53VXmyFiGpewNcg8Ld42WrSChpMzzskRWwHZfG9TJ7hPj8wzmKNrek3rW4ZkXNiHAjVchSmTr9aNUQaArK3KSkTySzjEM73FuDV62bjdAHF7EMnZ27poCE",
        "issuanceDate": "2020-01-01T12:00:00Z",
        "credentialSubject": {
          "givenName": "Sally",
          "familyName": "Student",
          "degree": {
            "type": "BachelorDegree",
            "degreeType": "Undergraduate",
            "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
          },
          "college": "Faber College"
        }
      },
      "options": {
        "proofType": "BbsBlsSignature2020"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that if you have the "auto" settings on, this is all you need to do.  Otherwise you need to call the `/send-request`, `/store`, etc endpoints to complete the protocol.

To see the issued credential, call the `/credentials/w3c` endpoint on Alice's admin api - this will return something like:

## Building More Realistic JSON-LD Credentials

The above example uses the "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1" context, which should not be used in a real application.

To build credentials in real life, you first determine which attributes you need and then include the appropriate contexts.


### Context schema.org

You can use attributes defined on [schema.org](https://schema.org).  Although this is *NOT RECOMMENDED* (included here for illustrative purposes only) as individual attributes can't be validated (see the comment later on).

You first include `https://schema.org` in the `@context` block of the credential as follows:

```
"@context": [
  "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
  "https://schema.org"
],
```

Then you review the [attributes and objects defined by `https://schema.org`](https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) and decide what you need to include in your credential.

For example to issue a credetial with [givenName](https://schema.org/givenName), [familyName](https://schema.org/familyName) and [alumniOf](https://schema.org/alumniOf) attributes, submit the following:

```
{
  "connection_id": "ad35a4d8-c84b-4a4f-a83f-1afbf134b8b9",
  "filter": {
    "ld_proof": {
      "credential": {
        "@context": [
          "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
          "https://schema.org"
        ],
        "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "Person"],
        "issuer": "did:key:zUC71pj2gpDLfcZ9DE1bMtjZGWCSLhkQsUCaKjqXtCftGkz27894pEX9VvGNiFsaV67gqv2TEPQ2aDaDDdTDNp42LfDdK1LaWSBCfzsQEyaiR1zjZm1RtoRu1ZM6v6vz4TiqDgU",
        "issuanceDate": "2020-01-01T12:00:00Z",
        "credentialSubject": {
          "givenName": "Sally",
          "familyName": "Student",
          "alumniOf": "Example University"
        }
      },
      "options": {
        "proofType": "BbsBlsSignature2020"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that with `https://schema.org`, if you include attributes that aren't defined by *any* context, you will *not* get an error.  For example you can try replacing the `credentialSubject` in the above with:

```
"credentialSubject": {
  "givenName": "Sally",
  "familyName": "Student",
  "alumniOf": "Example University",
  "someUndefinedAttribute": "the value of the attribute"
}
```

... and the credential issuance *should* fail, however `https://schema.org` defines a `@vocab` that by default all terms derive from ([see here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30945898/what-is-the-use-of-vocab-in-json-ld-and-what-is-the-difference-to-context/30948037#30948037)).

You can include more complex schemas, for example to use the schema.org [Person](https://schema.org/Person) schema (which includes `givenName` and `familyName`):

```
{
  "connection_id": "ad35a4d8-c84b-4a4f-a83f-1afbf134b8b9",
  "filter": {
    "ld_proof": {
      "credential": {
        "@context": [
          "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
          "https://schema.org"
        ],
        "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "Person"],
        "issuer": "did:key:zUC71pj2gpDLfcZ9DE1bMtjZGWCSLhkQsUCaKjqXtCftGkz27894pEX9VvGNiFsaV67gqv2TEPQ2aDaDDdTDNp42LfDdK1LaWSBCfzsQEyaiR1zjZm1RtoRu1ZM6v6vz4TiqDgU",
        "issuanceDate": "2020-01-01T12:00:00Z",
        "credentialSubject": {
          "student": {
            "type": "Person",
            "givenName": "Sally",
            "familyName": "Student",
            "alumniOf": "Example University"
          }
        }
      },
      "options": {
        "proofType": "BbsBlsSignature2020"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Credential-Specific Contexts

The recommended approach to defining credentials is to define a credential-specific vocaublary (or make use of existing ones).  (Note that these can include references to `https://schema.org`, you just shouldn't uste this directly in your credential.)

The following examples use the W3C citizenship and vaccination contexts:

```
{
  "connection_id": "ad35a4d8-c84b-4a4f-a83f-1afbf134b8b9",
  "filter": {
    "ld_proof": {
      "credential": {
        "@context": [
          "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
          "https://w3id.org/citizenship/v1"
